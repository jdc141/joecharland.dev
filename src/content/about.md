Hey! I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** at **BNY** based out of Pittsburgh, where I spend my days building financial applications that help keep money moving where it needs to go. I'm also pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science** at **Georgia Tech**, diving deep into **Computing Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence** - (Expected graduation: May 2027)

My work is all about building scalable web applications, automating the boring stuff, and making systems run faster. I geek out over clean code, efficient architecture, and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

## Current Course Work
<a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS 6200: Introduction to Operating Systems</a>

## Currently Exploring
- C / C++
- Operating Systems
- Vim
- Clean Code Principles

## Outside of Work

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me cheering on the **Pittsburgh Steelers** or **Pitt Football**, going for runs, or out on the pickleball court trying to improve my game. 🏓

I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself, whether that's learning a new tech stack or finally beating my PR on a 5K.
