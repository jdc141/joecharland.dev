I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** at **BNY** in Pittsburgh, where I develop and maintain mission-critical financial applications. I'm also pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science** at **Georgia Tech** (OMSCS program), concentrating in **Computing Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence**, with an expected graduation in May 2027.

My work focuses on building scalable web applications, automating development workflows, and optimizing system performance. I'm passionate about creating robust, maintainable software that operates efficiently at scale.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying active and exploring new interests. I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and learn new skills. Current obsessions are the Pittsburgh Steelers, University of Pittsburgh Men's Football, Running and like everyone my age... Pickleball.
