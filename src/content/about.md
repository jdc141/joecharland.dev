Hey! I'm a **Full Stack Software Engineer** at **BNY** in Pittsburgh, where I spend my days building financial applications that help keep money moving where it needs to go. I'm also pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science** at **Georgia Tech** (OMSCS program), diving deep into **Computing Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence**—because who doesn't love a good challenge? (Expected graduation: May 2027!)

My work is all about building scalable web applications, automating the boring stuff, and making systems run faster. I geek out over clean code, efficient architecture, and finding creative solutions to complex problems.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not staring at code, you'll probably find me cheering way too loudly for the **Pittsburgh Steelers** or **Pitt Football**, going for a run, or—like every millennial/Gen Z—playing pickleball and pretending I'm better at it than I actually am. 🏓

I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself, whether that's learning a new tech stack or finally beating my PR on a 5K.
