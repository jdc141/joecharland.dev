Clash Royale meets Capture the Flag — destroying towers is only half the battle. Escort the flag home to claim victory, or steal it to build your own defenses.

## Gameplay

Deploy units using Elixir, attack enemy towers across three lanes, and capture flags that spawn when towers fall. The twist? Flag carriers slow down and can't attack, creating intense escort and interception battles.

## Tech

Built for the web browser using HTML5 Canvas for rendering and WebSockets for real-time 1v1 multiplayer. Currently prototyping core mechanics and gameplay loop.
